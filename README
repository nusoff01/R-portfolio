R Portfolio

10/16 notes:

I began using R in September of 2014 in a class on Health Data. I really 
like the language because of the way it structures data - the idea of 
storing data in vectors for each variable seems rather intuitive. I'm 
just getting started but I'm looking forward to using shiny to create
a web app in the near future
